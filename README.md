This repository contains the data and programs needed to reproduce the results of the paper "Modeling the Age Pattern of Fertility: An Individual-Level Approach".

The initial step is to run compute/estimation/compute_ref_tables.R to obtain the reference tables. 
This is the most time-consuming step. The program is intended for a computing server.

Once the tables are computed, everything else follows from compute/main.R
